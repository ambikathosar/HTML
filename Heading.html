        A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial or textual form.
        A discrete monitor comprises a visual display, support electronics, power supply, housing, electrical connectors, and external user controls.    </p>
        
        <p>The display in modern monitors is typically an LCD with LED backlight, 
        having by the 2010s replaced CCFL backlit LCDs. Before the mid-2000s, most monitors used a cathode-ray tube (CRT) as the image output technology.
        [1] A monitor is typically connected to its host computer via DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-C, DVI, or VGA. Monitors sometimes use other proprietary connectors and signals to connect to a computer,
         which is less common.
